## 📦 **Data Collection Plan (Crowd + Crawl + Curate)**

### 1. **Crowd-Sourced Database (Gamified)**
- As users add bottles to their “Vault,” auto-log details:
  - Brand, Type, Price Paid, Location Bought, Occasion, Review
- Give XP/badges for contributing to new bottles
- Allow edits to suggest missing info (like Wikipedia)

🪙 _Reward with profile upgrades / social status, not goods._

---

### 2. **Initial Seed Data (Manual + Scraping)**
- Build base data for Top 1000 bottles in India:
  - From online retailers (Living Liquidz, WinePark)
  - Official brand websites
  - Community forums like r/whisky, alcohol blogs

✅ Create a basic product card: `Name | Type | ABV | Country | Avg Price Range | Popularity Score`

---

### 3. **Taste Graph Engine (Long-term)**
- Once you have enough crowd input, build:
  - “People who liked this also liked…”
  - “Your taste matches 84% of users who prefer Single Malt”
  - “This bottle is popular in Goa, not in Delhi”

---

## 🧠 **Example Use-Case (User POV)**
> _I hear “Monkey Shoulder” at a party. I open SpiritsVault:_
- **📸 See bottle photo**
- **🌍 Community reviews & vibe (“Best for house parties”)**
- **💰 Avg price: ₹2700–3200 (crowd-sourced)**
- **🧠 “Also liked: Glenlivet, Woodburns”**
- **📍 Top cities: Mumbai, Bangalore**
- **📝 Bar stories: “Had it after my first promotion!”**

Instant context. Instant curiosity. Instant engagement.
